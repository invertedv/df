- Think about cases for SQL funcs
- NewSQLcol and NewMemCol functions
- load sql and mem functions
- vApply for vector operations
- stringer method for Column and df


- do I used method with receiver or access directly? Be consistent.
- df to have function that checks a list of columns all are in df

- Incorporate inputs/outputs etc from funcDefs into actual function -- just have 1 struct for everything....
